# Bathroom-Specific Analysis Guidelines

## Bathroom Material Focus Areas

### Flooring Assessment
- **Water resistance**: Critical factor for all bathroom flooring
- **Tile condition**: Grout lines, cracked tiles, hollow-sounding areas
- **Vinyl condition**: Edges lifting, water seepage under seams
- **Subfloor integrity**: Soft spots indicating water damage, especially around toilet

### Wall Surface Evaluation
- **Moisture damage**: Water stains, mold, peeling paint/wallpaper
- **Tile walls**: Grout condition, missing/cracked tiles, especially in shower area
- **Drywall condition**: Behind toilet, around tub/shower, near sink areas
- **Ventilation impact**: Moisture-related deterioration patterns

### Fixture-Specific Analysis
- **Toilet area**: Floor condition around base, wax ring integrity signs
- **Tub/shower surround**: Tile, fiberglass, or solid surface condition
- **Vanity area**: Water damage to cabinet base, countertop edge sealing
- **Shower pan**: Leaks, cracks, proper drainage slope

### Plumbing Infrastructure
- **Supply lines**: Copper, PEX, galvanized steel condition and age
- **Shut-off valves**: Accessibility and operation condition
- **Drain conditions**: Slow drains indicating blockages or slope issues
- **Water pressure**: Adequate pressure for multiple fixture operation

## Bathroom-Specific Complexity Factors

### Moisture Management
- **Ventilation adequacy**: Fan size (CFM) vs. room size, ducting condition
- **Window ventilation**: Operable windows, privacy considerations
- **Vapor barriers**: Behind tile, around tub/shower areas
- **Waterproofing**: Existing waterproof membranes, needs assessment

### Electrical Considerations
- **GFCI requirements**: All bathroom outlets must be GFCI protected
- **Lighting zones**: Task lighting over vanity, ambient ceiling lighting
- **Fan wiring**: Dedicated circuit, switch placement, timer controls
- **Code compliance**: Outlet placement relative to water sources

### Space Constraints
- **Small footprint challenges**: Limited maneuvering room for installation
- **Standard vs. non-standard sizes**: Fixture replacement compatibility
- **Ceiling height**: Standard vs. low ceilings affecting fan/light installation
- **Access limitations**: Tight doorways, stair access for materials

### Structural Considerations
- **Floor joists**: Adequate support for heavy tile, stone installations
- **Wall framing**: Standard 16" vs. 24" centers for tile/heavy mirror mounting
- **Subfloor condition**: OSB vs. plywood, moisture damage extent
- **Ceiling support**: For exhaust fan mounting, heavy light fixtures

## Bathroom Quality Tier Mapping

### Good Tier Indicators
- Basic fixtures in working condition
- Standard white/almond color schemes
- Basic tile or vinyl flooring in fair condition
- Adequate ventilation and electrical safety

### Better Tier Opportunities
- Good plumbing rough-in supporting upgraded fixtures
- Adequate electrical for enhanced lighting and ventilation
- Space allows for improved storage and functionality
- Structural support for tile upgrades

### Best Tier Potential
- Premium plumbing infrastructure (separate tub/shower, multiple zones)
- High-end electrical supporting heated floors, premium lighting
- Excellent structural support for natural stone, heavy fixtures
- Generous space for luxury features and custom storage

## Bathroom Assembly Recommendations

### Standard Bathroom Assembly
- Basic fixture replacement, ceramic tile, standard vanity
- Paint-grade improvements, basic lighting, code compliance updates
- Suitable for: Small bathrooms, rental properties, basic functionality needs

### Premium Bathroom Assembly  
- Mid-range fixtures, porcelain tile, semi-custom vanity
- Enhanced lighting, improved ventilation, quality hardware
- Suitable for: Family bathrooms, good existing infrastructure

### Luxury Bathroom Assembly
- High-end fixtures, natural stone, custom cabinetry
- Designer lighting, heated floors, premium hardware and accessories
- Suitable for: Master bathrooms, complete renovations, luxury homes

## Critical Safety and Code Issues

### Immediate Safety Concerns
- **Electrical hazards**: Non-GFCI outlets, unsafe wiring near water
- **Structural issues**: Soft subfloors, rotted framing around tub/shower
- **Mold/mildew**: Health hazards requiring remediation
- **Plumbing leaks**: Active leaks causing ongoing damage

### Code Compliance Requirements
- **GFCI protection**: All outlets within 6 feet of water sources
- **Ventilation**: Minimum CFM requirements for room size
- **Fixture clearances**: Minimum distances between fixtures
- **Accessibility**: ADA considerations for universal design

## Moisture-Related Red Flags

### Water Damage Indicators
- **Staining patterns**: Yellow/brown stains on walls, ceilings
- **Soft spots**: Spongy feeling floors, especially around toilet
- **Mold growth**: Black spots, musty odors, health concerns
- **Tile issues**: Hollow sounds, loose tiles, deteriorated grout

### Ventilation Problems
- **Inadequate exhaust**: Undersized fan, poor ductwork
- **Moisture buildup**: Condensation on mirrors, walls, windows
- **Paint failure**: Peeling, bubbling paint from excess moisture
- **Window issues**: Rotted sills, condensation damage

## Fixture Condition Assessment

### Toilet Evaluation
- **Base condition**: Movement, water around base, wax ring failure
- **Internal function**: Flush mechanism, water level, running issues
- **Age indicators**: Color matching, efficiency (gallons per flush)

### Tub/Shower Assessment
- **Surface condition**: Chips, cracks, stains, refinishing potential
- **Surround condition**: Tile, fiberglass, or solid surface integrity
- **Plumbing function**: Water pressure, temperature control, drain flow
- **Accessibility**: Step-over height, safety features

### Vanity and Sink Analysis
- **Cabinet condition**: Water damage, door/drawer operation, storage adequacy
- **Countertop condition**: Laminate, cultured marble, natural stone assessment
- **Sink condition**: Chips, cracks, faucet operation, drain function
- **Storage efficiency**: Current layout effectiveness, improvement opportunities

Focus your bathroom analysis on these moisture-critical areas and safety considerations to provide accurate complexity assessment for bathroom renovation assemblies.
