# Kitchen-Specific Analysis Guidelines

## Kitchen Material Focus Areas

### Flooring Priorities
- **High-traffic durability**: Look for wear patterns near sink, stove, main walkways
- **Water resistance**: Assess damage from spills, especially near dishwasher and sink
- **Grout condition**: For tile floors, evaluate grout staining, cracking, missing sections
- **Subfloor moisture**: Look for warping, soft spots indicating water damage

### Wall Surface Analysis
- **Backsplash areas**: Identify tile type, condition, coverage area behind stove/sink
- **Grease/stain resistance**: Evaluate paint condition near cooking areas
- **Moisture damage**: Check areas near sink and dishwasher for water stains
- **Electrical considerations**: Note outlet locations and GFCI requirements

### Cabinet Assessment
- **Box construction**: Identify plywood vs. particleboard, condition of interior
- **Door style**: Shaker, raised panel, flat panel, glass inserts
- **Hardware condition**: Hinges, drawer slides, handles/knobs
- **Finish condition**: Paint, stain, laminate condition and repairability

### Countertop Evaluation  
- **Material identification**: Granite, quartz, laminate, butcher block, concrete
- **Edge condition**: Chips, cracks, wear patterns
- **Seam quality**: For multi-piece installations
- **Undermount vs. drop-in**: Sink mounting style affects replacement scope

### Appliance Integration
- **Built-in appliances**: Note integration requirements with cabinetry
- **Electrical/gas requirements**: 220V outlets, gas lines, ventilation
- **Space constraints**: Measure for standard vs. counter-depth refrigeration

## Kitchen-Specific Complexity Factors

### Plumbing Considerations
- **Water supply locations**: Hot/cold supply to sink, dishwasher, ice maker
- **Drain locations**: Main sink drain, dishwasher drain, disposal
- **Shut-off valve accessibility**: Under-sink valve conditions
- **Potential relocation needs**: Islands, peninsula additions

### Electrical Complexity
- **GFCI requirements**: All countertop outlets must be GFCI protected
- **Appliance circuits**: Dedicated circuits for major appliances
- **Under-cabinet lighting**: Existing wiring for task lighting
- **Island/peninsula power**: Special considerations for electrical to islands

### Ventilation Assessment
- **Range hood type**: Ducted vs. recirculating, CFM capacity
- **Ductwork condition**: For exterior venting, assess duct routing
- **Make-up air**: Code requirements for high-CFM ventilation

### Structural Considerations
- **Load-bearing walls**: Identify walls that cannot be removed
- **Island support**: Floor structure for heavy island installations
- **Ceiling height**: Standard 8ft vs. 9-10ft for cabinet options
- **Soffit conditions**: Above-cabinet space, utilities running through

## Kitchen Quality Tier Mapping

### Good Tier Indicators
- Functional layout with standard appliance sizes
- Basic electrical and plumbing in good condition
- Standard cabinet boxes with surface-level updates needed
- Laminate countertops acceptable with good edge condition

### Better Tier Opportunities
- Good bones with quality cabinet boxes
- Electrical supports higher-end appliances
- Plumbing allows for upgraded fixtures
- Space for enhanced storage solutions

### Best Tier Potential  
- Premium existing infrastructure (high ceilings, quality construction)
- Electrical panel supports high-end appliance loads
- Plumbing allows for luxury features (pot fillers, filtered water)
- Structural capacity for large islands, specialty storage

## Kitchen Assembly Recommendations

### Standard Kitchen Assembly
- Basic cabinet refresh, laminate countertops, standard appliances
- Paint-grade improvements, basic tile backsplash
- Suitable for: Fair condition existing infrastructure

### Premium Kitchen Assembly
- Quality cabinet upgrades, quartz countertops, stainless appliances  
- Custom backsplash, under-cabinet lighting, soft-close hardware
- Suitable for: Good existing infrastructure with upgrade potential

### Luxury Kitchen Assembly
- Custom cabinetry, natural stone counters, professional appliances
- Designer backsplash, integrated appliances, specialty storage
- Suitable for: Excellent bones or complete structural renovation

## Red Flags to Document

### Immediate Concerns
- **Water damage**: Soft subfloors, cabinet bottom deterioration
- **Electrical issues**: Insufficient outlets, no GFCI protection, old wiring
- **Structural problems**: Sagging counters, cabinet separation from walls
- **Code violations**: Missing GFCI, improper ventilation, unsafe gas connections

### Planning Considerations  
- **Space constraints**: Narrow galley kitchens, low ceilings, limited natural light
- **Access challenges**: Difficult material delivery routes, stair access
- **Permit requirements**: Structural changes, electrical upgrades, gas work
- **Neighbor considerations**: Shared walls in condos/townhomes
